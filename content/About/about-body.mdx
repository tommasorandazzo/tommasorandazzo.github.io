# Tommaso Randazzo

<span className="text-small">Full-Stack Drupal + React Developer</span>

Hey there! My name is Tommaso and I am a full-stack web developer and designer based in Chicago, IL (but with very strong Michigan roots ✋🏼). I harness powerful frameworks with custom back-end systems for perfect-fit solutions. I love to make sites that are enjoyable to look at, accessible to a wide audience, and painless to maintain.
