# Tommaso Randazzo

<span className="text-small">Full-Stack Drupal + React Developer</span>

Hey there! My name is Tommaso and I am a full-stack web developer and designer based in Chicago, IL (but with very strong Michigan roots ‚úãüèº). I love my work as a Software Developer at a top Drupal agency, Third and Grove. In my freelance projects through tommasocc (the place you are right now!), I also harness powerful front-end JavaScript frameworks to compliment complex and unique solutions efficiently and elegantly. I love to make sites that are enjoyable to look at, accessible to a wide audience, and painless to maintain.

When I'm not living in my IDE, you will also find me enjoying a walk through the city or enjoying live music, both performing and listening! I love so many various forms of art and love to use it to inform my work as a developer.
