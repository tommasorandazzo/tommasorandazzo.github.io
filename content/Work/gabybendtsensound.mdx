Gaby Bendtsen is a sound design and producer for video games, movies, music, and more! After attending Michigan State University together, Gaby and I discussed how a website could be used for her to both manage samples of her work and display it in a way that is sharable and unique for things like interviews.

I was happy to provide her with a user-editable site where she can add unlimited pages and data and manage her audio media as she sees fit. She is also able to create custom pages to share certain kinds of work with prospective workplaces. I am so happy we were able to iterate on this site twice now!
