Global Energy is a Chicago-based energy brokerage that primarily serves the Archidiocese of Chicago, among other businesses and establishments across the Chicagoland area. They help provide money saving and efficiency opportunities for their clients with their online energy dashboard, <a href="https://www.globalenergy.net/organize" target="_blank">Archnet™</a>, as well as with their small business touch.

I am proud to provide development work for Global Energy for their site as well as their Archnet™ dashboard. I am continuing to work with Global Energy to redesign their site to capture a wider audience and increase their capabilities via the site. I am also working with them to migrate their Archnet™ dashboard to a new platform. These plans will continue to go back to benefit their end users—new and returning customers.
